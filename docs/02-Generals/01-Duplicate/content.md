Title: Duplicate
---

Takes almost anything as input and returns a duplicate of the same passed variable in return.

#- Inputs
- input `anything` (almost anything - you know, for example don't use functions)

**Note**: Passing invalid input causes panic.

#- Outputs
- first `sameTypeAsInput`

#- Complexity
- `Duplicate` has a complexity of O(n) which in Best-Case scenario,
when variable is not too complicated, it can be O(1).
