Title: Setup
---

All that is need to do is a single line:
```
go get github.com/golodash/godash
```

**Note**: If you are running this command inside a directory which has no `go.mod` file inside it, this command does nothing.

**Note**: To create a module(`go.mod` file), use `go mod init example.com/m`.
